Graphite
@
The chapter of the earth's history thus sealed up
and stowed away among her geological records relates to a period now known as the Carboniferous, because of the
prevalence of seams or beds of coal throughout the formation at certain levels. By the slow process of chemical
decomposition without access of air, modified also by the mechanical pressure of superincumbent formations, the
vegetable deposits accumulated in the manner described have, in the lapse of ages, become transformed into the
substance now familiar to us as coal.

Although coal is thus essentially a product of Carboniferous age, it must not be concluded that this mineral is
found in no other geological formation. The conditions favourable for the deposition of beds of vegetable matter
have prevailed again and again, at various periods of geological time and on different parts of the earth, although
there is at present no distinct evidence that such a luxuriant growth of vegetation, combined with the other
necessary conditions, has ever existed at any other period in the history of the globe. Thus in the very oldest
rocks of Canada and the northern States of America, in strata which take us back to the dawn of geological history,
there is found abundance of the mineral graphite, the substance from which black-lead pencils are made, which
is almost pure carbon. Now most geologists admit that graphite represents the carbon which formed part of the woody
tissue of plants that lived during those remote times, so that this mineral represents coal in the ultimate stage of
carbonization. In some few instances true coal has been found converted into graphite in situ by the intrusion of
veins of volcanic rock (basalt), so that the connection between the two minerals is more than a mere matter of
surmise.

Then again we have coal of pre-Carboniferous age in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland, this being of course younger
in point of time than the graphite of the Archaean rocks. Coal of post-Carboniferous date is found in beds of Permian
age in Bavaria, of Triassic age in Germany, in the Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire belonging to the Jurassic period,
and in the Lower Cretaceous deposits of north-western Germany. Coming down to more recent geological periods, we
have a coal seam of over thirty feet in thickness in the northern Tyrol of Eocene age; we have brown coal deposits
of Oligocene age in Belgium and Austria, and, most remarkable of all, coal has been found of Miocene, that is,
mid-Tertiary age, in the Arctic regions of Greenland within a few degrees of the North Pole.
